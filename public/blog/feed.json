Unlike everyone, I'm mostly refusing to use social media, and since I'm not hugely into speaking with actual people in the so called real world, this seems like a viable option. (In other words this is a slightly less and slightly more crazy person technique for expressing the inner dialog.) ALSO there will be some pretty tedious notes to myself of a more practical nature - like WHEN did I last acquire our last ever non-stick pan? (this time I mean it!)</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-alert markdown-alert-tip\">\n<p class=\"markdown-alert-title\">Tip</p>\n<p>I'm using some features of the theme and blogging software here, like this tip, which isn't really a tip at all, mostly so I remember that they exist and have an example of how to use them laying around.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"how%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#how%3F\" class=\"header-anchor\">How?</a></h2>\n<p>The blog software <a href=\"https://lume.land/\">Lume</a> runs in\n<a href=\"https://deno.com/\">Deno</a>, using the pretty awesome <a href=\"https://lume.land/theme/xeo/\">Xeo theme</a></p>\n<div class=\"markdown-alert markdown-alert-note\">\n<p class=\"markdown-alert-title\">Note</p>\n<p>Like the tip that isn't a tip, this note is well, I guess it actually is a note.

For about four years, my Peloton user-name was &quot;Frog Breath&quot;. There was some non-happiness about it from people I love and/or respect, so I eventually changed it to &quot;Spiritus Ranae&quot; about which I have as yet heard no compliants. (Then again, an eye roll is silent!)</p>\n<h2 id=\"wut%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#wut%3F\" class=\"header-anchor\">Wut?</a></h2>\n<p>A few broad topics and particular ideas I might eventually get around to yammering about:</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-fantasy-letter-to-the-president\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#a-fantasy-letter-to-the-president\" class=\"header-anchor\">A Fantasy Letter to the President</a></h3>\n<p>I had this idea - entirely driven by magical thinking - that one could write a letter to our depraved president which could turn him around, make him see how cruel and counterproductive his whole schtick is and even get him to unbreak our hearts by fixing the enormous mess he's created.</p>\n<p>Could this actually work? Probably not. But should that keep us from writing such a letter?</p>\n<h3 id=\"northwestern-caved-and-pretended-not-to-cave\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#northwestern-caved-and-pretended-not-to-cave\" class=\"header-anchor\">Northwestern Caved and Pretended not to Cave</a></h3>\n<p>$75M but no admission of wrongdoing... so wrong!</p>\n<h3 id=\"back-when-i-had-gills\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#back-when-i-had-gills\" class=\"header-anchor\">Back When I Had Gills</a></h3>\n<p>There will be song titles for songs that may or may not ever get written.</p>\n<h3 id=\"always-be-crafting!\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#always-be-crafting!\" class=\"header-anchor\">Always Be Crafting!</a></h3>\n<p>love that section of <a href=\"https://wewillcraft.org/\">We Will Craft</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"cooking!\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#cooking!\" class=\"header-anchor\">Cooking!</a></h3>\n<p>asdf</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-crushing-disappiontment-with-pantone%E2%80%99s-2026-color-of-the-year\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#my-crushing-disappiontment-with-pantone%E2%80%99s-2026-color-of-the-year\" class=\"header-anchor\">My Crushing Disappiontment with Pantone’s 2026 Color of the Year</a></h3>\n<p>a white? really?</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-live-in-a-world-of-extreme-beauty%2C-which-is-on-fire-and-brimming-with-injustice%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#how-to-live-in-a-world-of-extreme-beauty%2C-which-is-on-fire-and-brimming-with-injustice%3F\" class=\"header-anchor\">How to Live in a world of extreme beauty, which is on fire and brimming with injustice?</a></h3>\n<h2 id=\"another-heading!\" tabindex=\"-1\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8000/instructions/#another-heading!\" class=\"header-anchor\">Another Heading!</a></h2>\n","date_published":"Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT"},{"id":"http://localhost:8000/differences/","url":"http://localhost:8000/differences/","title":"Is This Thing On?","content_html":"<p>Yes it is a blog!</p>\n","date_published":"Wed, 03 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT"}]}
