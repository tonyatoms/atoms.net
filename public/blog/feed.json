Unlike everyone, I'm mostly refusing to use social media, and since I'm not hugely into speaking with actual people in the so called real world, this seems like a viable option. (In other words this is a slightly less and slightly more crazy person technique for expressing the inner dialog.) ALSO there will be some pretty tedious notes to myself of a more practical nature - like WHEN did I last acquire our last ever non-stick pan?

For about four years, my Peloton user-name was &quot;Frog Breath&quot;. There was some non-happiness about it from people I love and/or respect, so I eventually changed it to &quot;Spiritus Ranae&quot; about which I have as yet heard no compliants.
