<p>Put another way: robots are paid a wage somewhat comparable to the wage that would have been paid to a human worker. Those wages are taxed at 100%. That tax income is then used to fund unemployment payments, and over time, gradually shifted over to pay for a universal basic income.</p>

          <p>I just added a tiny, privacy‑friendly “pageview counter” to this blog that runs for free, doesn’t use Google Analytics, and avoids collecting personal data.
​</p>
<h2>What problem this solves</h2>
<p>Most analytics tools track a lot more than many small sites need: they set cookies, profile visitors, and phone home to big platforms just to answer basic questions like “Which pages are people reading?” and “Is anyone visiting this thing?” The goal here was different: count visits and see which pages get attention, without building dossiers on readers or depending on gross ad‑tech companies.
​</p>
<h2>What I built instead</h2>
<p>A tiny web service (hosted on <a href="https://deno.com/deploy">Deno Deploy</a>) that receives a simple “someone/something viewed this page” message whenever a page on the site loads.
​</p>
<p>The service is a very small snippet of JavaScript added to the blog’s template that sends just three pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Which page was viewed (the URL path)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The page title</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the visitor came from on the site (the referrer)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The service does not store IP addresses, cookies, or unique identifiers—only high‑level information that’s useful for understanding traffic, not tracking people.
​</p>
<h2>How it works behind the scenes</h2>
<p>When someone opens a page on the site, their browser quietly makes a background request to the analytics service saying “Page /blog/archive/ was viewed.” The service checks that the request comes from a web page, updates an in‑memory counter for that page, and writes a brief log line (timestamp, path, title, referrer, and browser type).
​</p>
<h2>What makes it privacy‑respecting</h2>
<p>No cookies and no fingerprinting. The system doesn’t try to recognize or follow a person across visits; it only counts pageviews.
​</p>
<h3>Minimal data</h3>
<p>It records just enough to answer “what is being read?” rather than “who is reading it?”.
​</p>
<h2>Why this is a good fit for a personal blog</h2>
<p>For a small site or personal blog with no commericial interests whatsoever, the interesting questions are about content, not people: which posts resonate, which pages nobody sees, and whether the site is still alive in the eyes of readers. This setup answers those questions with a tiny, understandable, and host‑agnostic piece of plumbing - no dashboards, no trackers, and no dependence on ad‑network analytics.

          <p>The Japanese term, <em>sente</em> (先手) means "prior hand" or "first move". In the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>, sente translates roughly into the english term "initiative".</p>
<p>I've been spending a couple/few hours on most recent Monday evenings counter-protesting at our Alderwoman's office on Archer Avenue in Chicago. A very small, but obnoxiously loud group of <em>people</em> have been <a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2025/12/10/whats-the-future-of-archer-safe-streets-advocates-faced-off-against-car-activists-backed-by-pro-charter-school-lobbying-group-urban-center">stiring up opposition to a traffic safety project</a> on Archer which was approved after years of public meetings at which there was approximately zero opposition. The scheduling just happens to co-incide with "Ward Night" - the time when the ward staff and the alderwoman makes themselves available for walk-in visits from constituents (actually one can visit any time they are open). The loudest of the dozen or so regular protesters are afflilated with conservative groups opposed to our progressive alder. Their motives are suspect to say the least.</p>
<p>For reasons unrelated to the Archer Avenue astroturfing, I'm exhausted with participating in public protests, so I'm not objective. But I'd really rather spend my winter Monday evenings doing almost anything other than standing around in the cold showing support for the safety project by holding signs and quite possibly being mistaken for a protester, rather than a counter-protester by a subset(?) of the passing drivers who can be bothered to pay any attention at all to the situation.</p>
<p>At last night's counter-protest I was reminded of Go's concept of sente. It is a bit of an exaggeration, but I've heard it said that to lose sente - to lose intitiative - is to lose the game. After one has lost initiative, one's move is reactive and worse, there may only be one weak, defensive move to make and if that isn't bad enough, that move is dictated by one's opponent. The pain! To counter-protest is to react - in Go terms, this state of reacting to an opponent who has seized the initiative is called <em>gote</em> (後手) - literally, "after hand". There is a way out of the situation in Go called <em>tenuki</em> (手抜き) in which a player who has lost the initiative intentionally ignores the threat and instead of defending, makes a move elsewhere. I wonder if it may be time for tenuki on Archer?</p>
